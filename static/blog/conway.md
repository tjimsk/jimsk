#### CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE

This is a simplified multiplayer version of Conway's famous zero-player Game of Life implemented using a Go backend, Websocket and a React UI.  

You can put different shapes on the grid to see how they evolve and multiple players can interact (simply open multiple browser windows).

In case you've never heard of the game, this is the description from Wikipedia.

> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

> The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

And these are the 4 rules:

> - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
> - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
> - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
> - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
