### Description
I did multiple internships at Laserfiche while attending civil engineering school.  I was responsible for doing localization on all the French documentation, GUI and marketing material.  I also dealt with verifying the encoding of strings in multiple other language such as Arabic, Chinese, Korean, etc.  I also worked in marketing where I designed multiple pages using Dreamweaver, CSS and some beginner Javascript.

The responsibilities weren't so different although my title had changed multiple times.  It mainly consisted in implementing custom ECM solutions to fit customers' business process needs.

The following summarizes some of my achievements:

- Implemented, consulted for various ECM processes in financial, governmental and commercial sectors.
- Analysed organisations business processes and devised solutions for streamlining and auditing data operations.
- Designed, implemented multiple web forms, backend workflows and notification systems.
- Conducted multiple ECM migrations and database consolidation from legacy systems.
- Configured, maintained application servers, networks, databases.
- Conducted escalation troubleshooting for VIP customers. Systems profiling, applications and server optimisations.
- Designed and implemented client tools.
- Produced ECM system specifications in response to RFP's.

### Reason For Leaving
I wanted to devote more time in building apps and doing web development outside, and I wanted to explore non enterprise environments.
