### Description
In this role, I was primarily responsible for all frontend maintenance work, implementation of new features and adding any backend endpoints as necessary.  

The code that implemented the existing frontend used Django templates to return a server rendered view.  Any dynamic behavior was done via jQuery and _manual_ DOM manipulation.  Additional code was often written to establish synchronization between data sources.  I implemented new versions of the inventory, orders, shipments, tickets, and user profile pages while maintaining existing codebase.

The entire project consisting of multiple Django apps mapping to different stages of the purchasing process, knowing which app contains the source of truth of data types shared across apps was often a problem and source for bugs.  I helped refactor the database and all the related methods from a dozen of existing apps.
